title: As a Software Engineer
description: An exciting tale of growth, leadership, and full-stack mastery in web development

## Introduction
Hey there! Let me take you on an exciting journey through my evolution from a BSIT student to wearing multiple hats as a Scrum Master and Software Engineer. Trust me, it's been quite the adventure, filled with challenges, victories, and plenty of "aha!" moments that shaped me into the developer I am today.

## The Leadership Adventure

### Climbing the Agile Mountain
My journey kicked off with an exciting twist - I was appointed as one of two Scrum Masters in our project team! Working alongside the Project Manager and under the guidance of our Software Engineer teacher, I dove headfirst into the world of Agile methodologies. Think of me as the team's compass, helping everyone navigate through our development sprints.

### Kanban and GitHub: Our Digital Command Center
We turned GitHub's project management tools into our mission control, complete with a Kanban board that became our digital task headquarters. It was like having a high-tech mission board where every task, bug fix, and feature request found its perfect home. Watching those cards move from "To Do" to "Done" became oddly satisfying!

## The Technical Evolution

### Becoming the Swiss Army Knife Developer
Plot twist: I later evolved into a Software Engineer role, and that's when things got really interesting! I became what you might call a "tech Swiss Army knife" - you name it, I probably had to handle it. From teaching backend ninjas about APIs to helping frontend wizards master UI libraries like Tailwind and Astro, I was everywhere!

### The Project Juggling Act
While mentoring the team, I simultaneously led the development of three major projects:
- The DCCP Website (our digital storefront)
- DCCP Web Portal (where the magic happens)
- DCCP Mobile Portal (because everything needs to be mobile these days!)
- A robust Backend Server with auto-documented APIs (because good documentation is like a good cup of coffee - essential!)

## Lessons Learned & Self-Notes

### The Tech Stack Toolbox
- Frontend: Mastered the art of making things pretty and functional
- Backend: Learned that APIs are like LEGO blocks - they need to fit perfectly
- DevOps: Discovered that automation is your best friend
- Testing: Realized that breaking things intentionally is actually part of the job

### The Human Side
- Leadership isn't about knowing everything; it's about knowing who knows what
- Documentation is like leaving breadcrumbs for future you (and you'll thank yourself later)
- Teaching others is the best way to master something yourself
- Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one (KISS principle for the win!)

## Looking Forward
This journey has taught me that being a Software Engineer is less about the code you write and more about the problems you solve. It's about building bridges - between frontend and backend, between team members, and between ideas and implementation.

As I continue growing in this field, I carry these experiences like badges of honor, ready to tackle whatever new challenges come my way. After all, in the world of tech, the learning never stops - and that's exactly what makes it so exciting!
